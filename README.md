Web API solution for a data file validation. This solution should have 1 endpoint to upload and validate a file. File content is a newline separated list of account names and numbers (separated by a single space), which in case of being valid are actual bank account owner first names and account numbers.

Example content of the file is this:

Thomas 32999921
Richard 3293982
XAEA-12 8293982
Rose 329a982
Bob 329398.
michael 3113902
Rob 3113902p

Validation rules are:

1. First name should only consist of alphabetic characters (any symbol and numeric characters are not allowed), first letter should always be an uppercase
2. Account number is a 7 digit number (ex. 3293982) or 7 digit number + 'p' at the end (4113902p)
3. Valid account number must start with a digit 3 or 4 

Expected result after processing file should be:

1. In case of valid file - Web API gives a simple JSON response with content { fileValid: true }
2. In case at least single line is not valid JSON response should return fileValid = false and list of invalid lines with explanations, line number and actual line content. 

Example file response result would be:

{ fileValid: false,
invalidLines: [
              "Account number - not valid for 1 line 'Thomas 32999921'",
              "Account name, account number - not valid for 3 line 'XAEA-12 8293982'",
              "Account number - not valid for 4 line 'Rose 329a982'",
              "Account number - not valid for 5 line 'Bob 329398.'",
              "Account name - not valid for 6 line 'michael 3113902'"
]
} 

Measurement:

1. Time performance is measured between line validations, so we could differentiate which lines where the slowest and which were fastest to validate.
